# Quantum Galton Boards

This is Camil Champin's M1 internship report following 3 months at the Universidad de los Andes, Bogota Colombia.

The internship was lead under Pr. Alonso Botero Mejia's supervision.

The objective was to better understand the behaviour of many non-interacting indistinguishable bosons in the Boson Sampling framework, using a quantum walk-inspired approach.
